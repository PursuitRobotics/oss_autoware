# Gemini Code Assistant Project Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the Pursuit Robotics Autoware project to assist the Gemini code assistant in understanding the codebase.

## Project Purpose

This project is an extension of the Autoware Foundation build system for the Pursuit Robotics Autoware Stack. It provides a build environment and tools for developing and deploying the Autoware software on a native operating system (NOS).

This project is a fork of the official Autoware repository. We will periodically merge changes from the upstream Autoware community to incorporate the latest features and bug fixes. All proprietary changes and customizations will be isolated within the `pursuit` directory. The primary development and build activities are orchestrated from this directory.

## Key Technologies

*   **ROS2:** The core framework for the Autoware robotics software.
*   **colcon:** The build system used for ROS2 projects.
*   **rosdep:** A command-line tool for installing system dependencies for ROS packages.
*   **vcs:** A tool for importing and managing the various git repositories that make up the Autoware source code.
*   **Docker:** Used for containerization.
*   **Python:** Used for scripting and tooling.
*   **Make:** Used for orchestrating build tasks.
*   **pnpm/fnm:** Used for Node.js package management.

## Autoware Workspace

The Autoware project uses a workspace-based development approach. The workspace is comprised of the following directories:

*   `src/`: This directory contains the source code for all the Autoware ROS 2 packages. The source code is imported into this directory using the `vcs` tool and the `.repos` files. This directory is not tracked by git.
*   `build/`: This directory holds intermediate files generated by the build process.
*   `install/`: After a successful build, this directory contains the final, installed version of all the packages.
*   `log/`: This directory contains logs generated by `colcon` during the build process.

## Codebase Structure

The `pursuit` directory is the primary working directory for developers. It contains the following:

*   `data/`: Contains sample data for testing and simulation.
*   `docs/`: Contains project documentation.
*   `infra/`: Contains infrastructure-related scripts and configurations.
*   `tools/`: Contains custom tools for the project.
*   `Makefile`: Defines the main build tasks.
*   `*.repos`: Files that define the git repositories for the Autoware source code.

## Important Commands

*   `make --help`: Display the list of available make tasks.
*   `make nos-setup-dev-no-cuda`: Set up the development environment.
*   `make nos-workspace-autoware`: Create the Autoware workspace.
*   `make nos-ros-deps`: Install ROS2 dependencies.
*   `make nos-build`: Build the Autoware software.
*   `make launch-planning-simulator`: Launch the planning simulator.

## Launching Simulators

The `LAUNCH.md` file contains detailed instructions on how to launch various simulators:

*   **Planning Simulator:** `ros2 launch autoware_launch planning_simulator.launch.xml ...`
*   **Rosbag Simulator:** `ros2 launch autoware_launch logging_simulator.launch.xml ...`
*   **Scenario Testing:** `ros2 launch scenario_test_runner scenario_test_runner.launch.py ...`
*   **Random Test Simulation:** `ros2 launch random_test_runner random_test.launch.py ...`

## ROS2 Resources

The `ROS2.md` file contains a collection of useful resources for learning and working with ROS2.

## Gemini Directives

*   All generated files should be placed in the `pursuit/` directory.
