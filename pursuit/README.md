# Pursuit Robotics Autoware Stack: Build and Development Environment

This repository provides the build environment and necessary tooling to develop, build, and deploy the Pursuit Robotics Autoware Stack. It extends the Autoware Foundation's build system, enabling a streamlined development workflow on a native operating system (NOS).

This project is a fork of the official Autoware repository. We will periodically merge changes from the upstream Autoware community to incorporate the latest features and bug fixes. All proprietary changes and customizations will be isolated within the `pursuit` directory. The primary development and build activities are orchestrated from this directory.

## Target Audience

This document is intended for software engineers and developers actively contributing to the Pursuit Robotics Autoware Stack.

## Development Environment Setup

This section outlines the different methods for setting up a development environment for the Pursuit Robotics Autoware Stack.

### Native OS (Bare Metal) Installation

This method involves building the Autoware stack directly on a pristine Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy) operating system.

#### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed on your development machine:

- Git
- Python 3
- Docker and Docker Compose
- pnpm and fnm

The `infra/scripts/nos_setup.sh` script can be used as a reference for installing these prerequisites.

#### 2. Environment Setup

To set up the development environment, execute the following command from the `pursuit` directory:

```bash
make nos-setup-dev-no-cuda
```

This command will install all the necessary dependencies and tools required to build the Autoware stack.

#### 3. Workspace Creation

Create the Autoware workspace by running the following command from the `pursuit` directory:

```bash
make nos-workspace-autoware
```

This will check out the Autoware source code into the `src/` directory, based on the repositories defined in the `.repos` files.

#### 4. Dependency Installation

Install the ROS 2 dependencies for the Autoware packages using `rosdep`:

```bash
make nos-ros-deps
```

#### 5. Building the Autoware Stack

Compile the Autoware source code using `colcon`:

```bash
make nos-build
```

#### 6. Verification

To verify the build, launch the planning simulator:

```bash
make launch-planning-simulator
```

Refer to the `LAUNCH.md` file for more detailed information on launching various simulation and testing scenarios.

### Container-Based Environments

For a more isolated and reproducible development environment, we provide container-based solutions.

#### Monolithic Build

(Coming Soon) This section will describe how to build and run the Autoware stack within a single, self-contained Docker container.

#### Orchestrated Docker Images with OpenAD Kit

(Coming Soon) This section will provide instructions on how to use the OpenAD Kit to build and run the Autoware stack as a set of orchestrated Docker containers. The OpenAD Kit simplifies the development and deployment of Autoware by providing pre-configured `devel` and `runtime` Docker images.

## High-Level Architecture

The Pursuit Robotics Autoware Stack is built upon the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) and the Autoware Foundation's open-source autonomous driving software. This repository provides a set of Makefiles, scripts, and configurations to manage the build process and development environment.

The core components of this build environment are:

- **Make-based Build System:** A `Makefile` within the `pursuit` directory orchestrates the entire build process.
- **colcon:** The primary build tool for ROS 2, used to build the Autoware workspace.
- **rosdep:** A command-line tool for installing system dependencies for ROS packages.
- **vcs:** A tool for importing and managing the various git repositories that make up the Autoware source code.
- **.repos Files:** These files define the specific versions of the various git repositories that constitute the Autoware source code.

## Autoware Workspace

The Autoware project uses a workspace-based development approach. The workspace is comprised of the following directories, which are created and managed by the build system:

- `src/`: Contains the source code for all the Autoware ROS 2 packages, imported using the `vcs` tool. This directory is not tracked by git.
- `build/`: Holds intermediate files generated by the build process.
- `install/`: Contains the final, installed version of all the packages.
- `log/`: Contains logs generated by `colcon` during the build process.

## Codebase Structure

The `pursuit` directory is the primary working directory for developers. It contains the following:

- `data/`: Contains sample data for testing and simulation.
- `docs/`: Contains project documentation.
- `infra/`: Contains infrastructure-related scripts and configurations.
- `tools/`: Contains custom tools for the project.
- `Makefile`: Defines the main build tasks.
- `*.repos`: Files that define the git repositories for the Autoware source code.
